Project Title: Deepfake Forensics Suite: An AI-Powered Detection & Analysis System
1. Introduction & Problem Statement The rapid advancement of deepfake technology—synthetic media generated by AI—has escalated the risks of misinformation, fraud, and identity theft. For the average user, distinguishing between authentic and manipulated video or audio content is becoming increasingly difficult. Our project, the Deepfake Forensics Suite, is a comprehensive solution designed to detect these manipulations using advanced artificial intelligence, empowering users to verify the authenticity of digital content with high accuracy.

2. Core Functionalities Our system provides three primary forensic capabilities:

🎥 Video Deepfake Detection:

Method: We employ a Transfer Learning approach using the XceptionNet (CNN) architecture.

Custom Training: While we leverage the pre-trained base of XceptionNet for robust feature extraction, we specifically trained the upper two dense layers of the model on a specialized deepfake dataset (FaceForensics++). This fine-tuning allows the model to focus on specific artifacts inherent to face-swapping and neural synthesis rather than general object recognition.

Process: Faces are extracted from video frames using a Haar Cascade classifier and fed into our fine-tuned Xception model. The model analyzes subtle inconsistencies in skin texture and facial landmarks to output a real/fake probability score.

🎙️ Audio Deepfake Detection:

Method: Spectral analysis utilizing Wav2Vec 2.0 (Transformers) combined with statistical heuristics.

Process: The system analyzes the audio waveform and spectrogram, calculating metrics like the Zero Crossing Rate (ZCR) and identifying frequency patterns that are characteristic of synthetic speech (TTS) but absent in natural human speech.

Output: Classification of the audio as either AI-generated or human speech.

🧬 Voice Cloning Simulation (Educational Tool):

Method: Utilizes XTTS v2 / gTTS for text-to-speech synthesis.

Purpose: This feature serves an educational purpose, demonstrating how easily AI can clone a voice, thereby raising awareness about the potential dangers of this technology.

3. Technical Architecture The project is built on a robust Client-Server Architecture:

Frontend: A modern, responsive User Interface developed with HTML5, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. It handles file inputs and presents complex analysis data in an intuitive, graphical format.

Backend: A Python (Flask) server acts as the core engine, managing API endpoints and orchestrating the heavy AI processing tasks via TensorFlow and PyTorch.

Security: We utilize werkzeug for secure file handling and have enabled Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to ensure safe communication between the client and server.

4. Innovation & Impact This tool goes beyond simple detection; it is a complete forensic utility. The "Forensic Report Generation" feature provides users with a downloadable PDF report detailing the analysis, which is crucial for professional verification. By combining deep learning (fine-tuned XceptionNet) with heuristic analysis, we ensure a robust and reliable detection mechanism.

5. Conclusion The Deepfake Forensics Suite is a significant step forward in digital content verification. By packaging complex AI technology—specifically our custom-trained dense layers—into a user-friendly interface, we make powerful forensic tools accessible to everyone, helping to restore trust in digital media.
